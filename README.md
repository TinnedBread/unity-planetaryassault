# unity-planetaryassault
A Game Jam game created in Unity at Bournemouth University, UK.

The theme for this Game Jam was "UFO".

The goal of the game is for the player to pilot their ship around a planet and destroy the defences and structures. Doing so will earn currency, which can then be spent on upgrading their ship.

Upon destroying a certain amount of structures, the next planet will become unlocked.
